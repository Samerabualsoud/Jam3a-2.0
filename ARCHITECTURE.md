# Jam3a Backend Architecture

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Jam3a backend architecture, which powers the Jam3a group buying platform. The backend is designed to support the core functionality of bringing people together to benefit from bulk deals with suppliers.

## System Architecture

The Jam3a backend follows a modular, layered architecture:

1. **API Layer**: Express.js routes and controllers that handle HTTP requests
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and external integrations (Moyasser payment gateway)
3. **Data Access Layer**: MongoDB models and database operations
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Configuration, middleware, and utilities

### Key Components

- **Express.js Server**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores all application data
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures API endpoints
- **Moyasser Integration**: Processes payments
- **Content Management System**: Manages website content

## Core Features

   - Group joining mechanism
   - Progress tracking
   - Automatic completion handling

2. **Product Management**
   - Comprehensive product catalog
   - Categorization and filtering
   - Featured products
   - Multilingual support (English/Arabic)

3. **User Management**
   - Registration and authentication
   - Role-based access control (user, admin, seller)
   - Profile management
   - Password reset functionality

4. **Order Processing**
   - Order creation and tracking
   - Status management
   - Shipping information

5. **Payment Processing**
