# Direct Fix for Digital Ocean Deployment

This file contains a direct fix for the Digital Ocean deployment issues with the Jam3a-2.0 repository. The main issue is that Digital Ocean is still using an older commit and not picking up our latest changes.

## Problem Identified

1. Digital Ocean is deploying an older commit (dd72d7d70cbf1e8b093cc13452284a4757b952bd)
2. The build is failing because it can't find the '@radix-ui/react-separator' dependency
3. The deployment is trying to use Next.js instead of Vite

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a more robust solution that will work regardless of which commit is being used:

1. Added a direct installation script for the missing dependency in the Dockerfile
2. Created a more comprehensive build process that ensures all dependencies are installed
3. Added explicit installation steps for client dependencies
4. Modified the build command to properly handle the project structure

These changes should resolve the deployment issues even if Digital Ocean continues to use the older commit.

## Next Steps

After deploying with these changes, you should:

1. Check the Digital Ocean dashboard to ensure the deployment is using the latest commit
2. If needed, manually trigger a new deployment from the Digital Ocean dashboard
3. Consider setting up a webhook to automatically trigger deployments on new commits

If you continue to experience issues, please provide access to your Digital Ocean dashboard so we can investigate further.
