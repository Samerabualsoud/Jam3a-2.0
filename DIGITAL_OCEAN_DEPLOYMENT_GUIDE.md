# Digital Ocean Deployment Guide for Jam3a

This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the Jam3a application to Digital Ocean App Platform, ensuring a successful deployment without blank page issues.

## Deployment Options

We've configured two deployment options for maximum flexibility:

### Option 1: Static Site Deployment (Recommended)

This option deploys the application as a static site, which is simpler and more reliable for single-page applications.

1. In Digital Ocean dashboard, create a new App
2. Select "GitHub" as the source
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Select the branch to deploy (usually `main`)
5. Select "Static Site" as the resource type
6. Configure the build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
7. Add the following HTTP routes:
   - Source Path: `/*`
   - Destination Path: `/index.html`
8. Deploy the application

### Option 2: Web Service Deployment

This option deploys the application as a web service with a Node.js server.

1. In Digital Ocean dashboard, create a new App
2. Select "GitHub" as the source
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Select the branch to deploy (usually `main`)
5. Select "Web Service" as the resource type
6. Configure the build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Run Command: `npm start`
7. Set the HTTP port to `8080`
8. Deploy the application

## Troubleshooting Blank Page Issues

If you encounter a blank page after deployment, try these solutions:

1. **Check the browser console for errors**
   - Open developer tools (F12) and look for error messages

2. **Verify the deployment logs**
   - In Digital Ocean dashboard, go to your app > Logs
   - Look for any build or runtime errors

3. **Try the static site deployment option**
   - The static site option is more reliable for SPA deployments

4. **Clear browser cache**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear your browser cache

5. **Check network requests**
   - In developer tools, go to the Network tab
   - Look for failed requests to JavaScript or CSS files

## Performance Optimization

The application has been optimized for performance:

- Hash-based routing for better static site compatibility
- Code splitting for faster initial load
- Preloading of critical assets
- Fallback content for all routes
- Comprehensive error handling

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment:

1. **Monitor application health**
   - Digital Ocean provides health checks and metrics

2. **Check error logs**
   - The application includes built-in error reporting
   - Errors are logged to the console and session storage

3. **Update the application**
   - Push changes to your GitHub repository
   - Digital Ocean will automatically rebuild and deploy
