# Deployment Fixes for Jam3a 2.0

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve deployment issues with the Jam3a 2.0 platform on Digital Ocean. These fixes address build failures that were preventing successful deployment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API_BASE_URL Export Issue

**Problem:**
The build was failing with the error: `"API_BASE_URL" is not exported by "src/services/api.ts", imported by "src/services/DealService.ts"`.

**Fix:**
- Modified `src/services/api.ts` to properly export the `API_BASE_URL` constant
- Changed from:
  ```typescript
  const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? 'https://api.jam3a.com/api' // Production URL
    : 'http://localhost:5000/api'; // Development URL
  ```
- To:
  ```typescript
  export const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? 'https://api.jam3a.com/api' // Production URL
    : 'http://localhost:5000/api'; // Development URL
  ```

**Affected Files:**
- `/src/services/api.ts`
- `/src/services/DealService.ts` (uses the import)
- `/src/services/CategoryService.ts` (uses the import)

### 2. CSS Import Warning

**Problem:**
The build was showing a warning: `@import must precede all other statements (besides @charset or empty @layer)` related to font imports in the CSS file.

**Fix:**
- Moved the font import statement to the top of the CSS file, before the Tailwind directives
- Changed from:
  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;

  /* Font imports - must be before other statements */
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cairo:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Tajawal:wght@400;500;700&display=swap');
  ```
- To:
  ```css
  /* Font imports - must be before other statements */
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cairo:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Tajawal:wght@400;500;700&display=swap');

  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```

**Affected Files:**
- `/src/index.css`

## Verification

The fixes were verified by running a local build process, which completed successfully:

```
> jam3a-hub-collective@1.0.0 build
> vite build
vite v5.4.10 building for production...
...
âœ“ built in 13.18s
```

## Remaining Warnings

The build process still shows some non-critical warnings that don't prevent successful deployment:

1. **Browserslist Warning**: "Browserslist: browsers data (caniuse-lite) is 7 months old."
   - This can be fixed by running `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` but is not required for successful deployment.

2. **Asset Resolution Warning**: "/images/pattern.svg referenced in /images/pattern.svg didn't resolve at build time"
   - This is related to a background pattern image and doesn't affect functionality.

3. **Chunk Size Warning**: "Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification."
   - This is a performance optimization suggestion, not an error.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up to date
3. Run `npm run build` to create a production build
4. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting environment

For Digital Ocean App Platform:
- Connect your GitHub repository
- Set the build command to `npm run build`
- Set the output directory to `dist`
- Configure environment variables as needed
