# Digital Ocean Deployment Fix Package

This package contains all the necessary files and instructions to fix the deployment issues with the Jam3a-2.0 repository on Digital Ocean.

## Problem Identified

Digital Ocean is consistently deploying an older commit (dd72d7d70cbf1e8b093cc13452284a4757b952bd) rather than using the latest code from the main branch. This is causing the build to fail because it can't find the '@radix-ui/react-separator' dependency.

## Solution

This package provides two options to fix the issue:

### Option 1: Update Digital Ocean App Platform Settings

1. Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
2. Navigate to your App Platform section
3. Select the Jam3a-2.0 application
4. Go to the Settings tab
5. Look for "Source Code" or "Deployment" settings
6. Check if there's a specific commit hash pinned (dd72d7d70cbf1e8b093cc13452284a4757b952bd)
7. Update the settings to use the latest commit from the main branch
8. Trigger a new deployment

### Option 2: Manual Fix Application

If Option 1 doesn't work or isn't possible, you can manually apply the fixes:

1. Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
2. Navigate to your App Platform section
3. Select the Jam3a-2.0 application
4. Go to the Console tab (if available)
5. Apply the fixes directly in the environment:
   - Install the missing dependency: `npm install @radix-ui/react-separator@1.1.2`
   - Add the dependency to the client directory: `cd client && npm install @radix-ui/react-separator@1.1.2`
   - Modify the build process to include the dependency installation

### Option 3: Create a New Deployment

If neither Option 1 nor Option 2 works:

1. Create a new App Platform deployment
2. Connect it to your GitHub repository
3. Ensure it uses the latest commit from the main branch
4. Configure the build and run commands as specified in the included configuration files
