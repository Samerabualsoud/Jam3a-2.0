# Detailed Deployment Instructions for Digital Ocean

This document provides step-by-step instructions for fixing the deployment issues with the Jam3a-2.0 repository on Digital Ocean.

## Issue Summary
Digital Ocean is consistently deploying an older commit (dd72d7d70cbf1e8b093cc13452284a4757b952bd) rather than using the latest code from the main branch. This is causing the build to fail because it can't find the '@radix-ui/react-separator' dependency.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Digital Ocean App Platform Settings

1. Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
2. Navigate to your App Platform section
3. Select the Jam3a-2.0 application
4. Go to the Settings tab
5. Look for "Source Code" or "Deployment" settings
6. Check if there's a specific commit hash pinned (dd72d7d70cbf1e8b093cc13452284a4757b952bd)
7. Update the settings to use the latest commit from the main branch
8. Trigger a new deployment

### Option 2: Modify Build Command in Digital Ocean

1. Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
2. Navigate to your App Platform section
3. Select the Jam3a-2.0 application
4. Go to the Settings tab
5. Find the "Build Command" setting
6. Replace the current build command with:
   ```
   npm install @radix-ui/react-separator@1.1.2 && cd client && npm install @radix-ui/react-separator@1.1.2 && cd .. && npm install && npm run build
   ```
7. Save the changes
8. Trigger a new deployment

### Option 3: Upload Standalone Fix Files

If the above options don't work, you can manually upload the fix files:

1. Download all files from the `standalone-fix` directory
2. Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
3. Navigate to your App Platform section
4. Select the Jam3a-2.0 application
5. Go to the "Components" tab
6. Select your web service component
7. Look for an option to "Upload Files" or "Replace Files"
8. Upload the Dockerfile, package.json, and digitalocean.app.yaml files
9. Trigger a new deployment

### Option 4: Create a New Deployment

If all else fails, create a new deployment:

1. Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
2. Navigate to your App Platform section
3. Click "Create App"
4. Connect to your GitHub repository
5. Select the main branch
6. In the settings, make sure to:
   - Use the Dockerfile from the standalone-fix directory
   - Set the build command to include dependency installation
   - Configure all environment variables from your existing app
7. Complete the setup and deploy

## Verifying the Fix

After applying any of the above solutions:

1. Monitor the deployment logs
2. Check if the '@radix-ui/react-separator' dependency is being installed
3. Verify that the build completes successfully
4. Test the deployed application to ensure it's working correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the Digital Ocean deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure that the build command is being executed properly
4. Try manually installing the dependency through the Digital Ocean console if available

## Support

If none of these solutions work, please provide:
1. Screenshots of your Digital Ocean App Platform settings
2. Complete deployment logs
3. Access to your Digital Ocean dashboard (if possible)

This will help in providing more targeted assistance for your specific deployment configuration.
