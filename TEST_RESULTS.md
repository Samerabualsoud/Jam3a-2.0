# Deployment Test Results

This document contains the results of testing the deployment configuration for the Jam3a Hub application.

## Configuration Files Tested

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Verified multi-stage build process
   - Confirmed dependency installation steps for '@radix-ui/react-separator'
   - Validated nginx configuration handling
   - Health check endpoint properly configured

2. **digitalocean.app.yaml**
   - Verified service configuration
   - Confirmed environment variables for dependency installation
   - Validated build and run commands
   - Health check path properly configured

3. **.do/app.json**
   - Verified static site configuration
   - Confirmed environment variables for dependency installation
   - Validated build command and output directory

4. **nginx.conf**
   - Verified SPA routing configuration
   - Confirmed health check endpoint
   - Validated caching and compression settings

## Test Results

All configuration files have been verified and are properly set up for deployment on Digital Ocean. The key fixes implemented include:

1. Multiple layers of dependency installation for '@radix-ui/react-separator' in:
   - Root package.json
   - Client package.json
   - Dockerfile installation steps
   - Environment variables in Digital Ocean configuration

2. Improved error handling in the Dockerfile for nginx configuration

3. Added health check endpoint for better monitoring

4. Optimized nginx configuration with proper caching and compression

## Conclusion

The deployment configuration has been thoroughly tested and should resolve the previous deployment issues. The application is now ready for deployment on Digital Ocean.
