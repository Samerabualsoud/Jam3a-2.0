# Jam3a Platform - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the fixes and enhancements implemented for the Jam3a platform. The platform has been thoroughly reviewed and improved to ensure a fully functioning website that serves the group buying concept effectively.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Authentication System

- Fixed the critical "ri.clearToken is not a function" error by implementing proper token handling
- Enhanced the AuthContext with consistent token management across different storage locations
- Improved error handling during login, registration, and logout processes
- Added proper token verification for secure authentication

### 2. Form Validation

- Implemented robust phone number validation with support for Saudi formats:
  - 05xxxxxxxx (Saudi mobile with leading zero)
  - 5xxxxxxxx (Saudi mobile without leading zero)
  - +9665xxxxxxxx (International format)
- Added credit card validation using the Luhn algorithm for secure payment processing
- Enhanced input formatting for better user experience:
  - Automatic formatting of credit card numbers with spaces
  - Proper MM/YY formatting for expiry dates
  - Consistent phone number formatting

### 3. Backend Security

- Enabled authentication middleware across all protected routes
- Implemented proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own data
- Updated routes to use req.user.id from auth middleware instead of insecure req.body.userId
