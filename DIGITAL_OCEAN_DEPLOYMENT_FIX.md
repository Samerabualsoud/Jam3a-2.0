# Digital Ocean Deployment Fix Documentation

## Issue Identified
The Jam3a-2.0 repository was failing to deploy on Digital Ocean due to a critical mismatch between the project's structure and the deployment configuration:

1. The project uses Vite for local development and building, as evidenced in the package.json scripts.
2. The Digital Ocean deployment was attempting to use Next.js for building, causing dependency resolution errors.
3. Specifically, the build was failing with: "Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-separator'" despite this dependency being correctly listed in client/package.json.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
Created a proper multi-stage Dockerfile that:
- Uses node:18-alpine for the build stage
- Installs dependencies from both root and client package.json files
- Builds the application using Vite
- Uses nginx:alpine for the production stage to serve the static files

### 2. Updated Digital Ocean Configuration
- Modified digitalocean.app.yaml to use the Dockerfile for deployment
- Updated the .do/app.json configuration to align with Vite-based build process
- Ensured all build and run commands are compatible with the Vite configuration

### 3. Dependency Resolution
- Ensured '@radix-ui/react-separator' and other UI dependencies are properly installed
- Fixed the build process to correctly resolve all dependencies from client/package.json

## Expected Results
These changes should resolve the deployment errors by:
1. Using the correct build process (Vite instead of Next.js)
2. Properly installing all required dependencies
3. Generating the correct static files for deployment

## Future Considerations
- Consider consolidating package.json files to simplify dependency management
- Ensure any new UI components have their dependencies properly listed
- Update deployment documentation to reflect these changes
