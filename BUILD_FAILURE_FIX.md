# Jam3a Project - Build Failure Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified
The build was failing with the following error:
```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "nodemailer" from "/workspace/src/services/EmailService.ts".
```

This occurred because the client-side code was directly importing `nodemailer`, which is a server-side library that cannot be bundled with client-side code in a Vite/React application.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Client/Server Separation for Email Functionality

#### Client-Side Changes:
- Rewrote `src/services/EmailService.ts` to remove direct nodemailer dependencies
- Implemented a client-side API that uses fetch to communicate with server endpoints
- Maintained all email templates and functionality while removing server-side dependencies

#### Server-Side Implementation:
- Created `server/emailService.js` with the nodemailer implementation
- Added `server/routes/emailRoutes.js` with proper API endpoints for email operations
- Created `server/serverDependencies.js` to isolate server-side dependencies
- Updated `server.js` to serve both the API endpoints and the static files

### 2. Build Configuration Updates
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to explicitly exclude server-side dependencies:
  ```javascript
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['nodemailer', 'express', 'cors']
    }
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['nodemailer', 'express', 'cors']
  }
  ```

### 3. Package.json Updates
- Updated scripts to properly handle both client and server components
- Added necessary dependencies for server functionality
- Configured proper start script to run the server after build

## How to Deploy
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Build the project with `npm run build`
4. Start the server with `npm start`

## Environment Variables
For email functionality to work properly, set the following environment variables:
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your Microsoft Outlook email (default: Samer@jam3a.me)
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your email password

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
- The build process completes successfully without the previous error
- The client-side code properly communicates with the server API
- Email functionality works as expected

All changes have been pushed to the GitHub repository and should now build and deploy correctly.
